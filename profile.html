		<h2>A little introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, thanks for visiting my page! My name is Taha Manjoura, I am a professional who is passionate about coding and cyber security. I have had this passion since I was little, originally born in Morocco. I always wanted to make an impact on the world, whether that be through security or making a difference in company’s technology to serve their customers. I am currently attending a coding bootcamp, and will graduate mid-November. Prior to the bootcamp, I have 6 years of experience in fraud prevention, primarily in the finance industry. I received my Bachelor’s Degree from Metro State University in computer science in 2016. My hope is to put hard work into this bootcamp and earn my way into the developer/ cyber security career field.</p>
